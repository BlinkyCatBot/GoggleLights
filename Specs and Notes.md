* Size: The Gemma is 1.1" / 28mm diameter and 0.28" / 7mm thick.

* ATtiny85 on-board, 8K of flash, 512 byte of SRAM, 512 bytes of EEPROM

* Internal oscillator runs at 8MHz

* Draws 9 mA while running

* Approximately 5.25K bytes available for use (2.75K taken for the bootloader)

* On-board 3.3V power regulator with 150mA output capability and ultra-low dropout. Up to 16V input, reverse-polarity protection, thermal and current-limit protection.

* Power with either USB or external output (such as a battery) - it'll automatically switch over

* 3 GPIO - The 3 independent IO pins have 1 analog input and 2 PWM output as well.

* Hardware I2C capability for breakout & sensor interfacing.

* GEMMA does not have a Serial port connection for debugging so the serial port monitor will not be able to send/receive data.

* GEMMA is not supported on Linux operating system at this time, but is supported on both Mac OS and Windows.
