* GEMMA's D1 pin is wired to the first pixel ring's input pin. 

* Signal output of first ring chains to subsequent ring's input pin.

* GEMMA's Vout pin is wired to both pixel ring's VCC pins. 

* GEMMA's ground pin is wired to both the rings' GND pins.

* To add a power switch, cut and strip one of the wires leading to your battery.

* Add two small pieces of heat shrink tubing to the stripped wires and solder to two legs of the small switch (center leg and one outer leg). Slide the heat shrink to cover the exposed metal and shrink with a heat gun.

* Use a piece of foam tape to stick the battery behind the GEMMA, with the switch sticking out the side. Plug in the battery and glue the switch in place.
