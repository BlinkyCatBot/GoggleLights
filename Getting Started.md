Before getting started, you will need to download the following on a **Mac or Windows machine** (GEMMA is not supported on Linux):

*[Arduino IDE for GEMMA](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-gemma/setting-up-with-arduino-ide). Please follow the directions for the various downloads on the Adafruit website with one modification. If you are adding the Trinket Hardware Support to a previously downloaded Arduinio IDE, move the extracted support files to the Arduino "hardware" folder NOT the sketches folder. After moving the file, open the Arduino IDE and verify that "Adafruit Gemma" now appears as a board option.

*[AVR Dude for GEMMA](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/programming-with-avrdude). IMHO, the instructions are much more clear here than the steps listed in "Introducing Gemma".

*[Neopixel library for Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/archive/master.zip)
